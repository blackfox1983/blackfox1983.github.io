This is a Title
===============
That has a paragraph about a main subject and is set when the '='
is at least the same length of the title itself.

Subject Subtitle
----------------
Subtitles are set with '-' and are required to have the same length 
of the subtitle itself, just like titles.

Lists can be unnumbered like:

 * 项目 Foo
 * 项目 Bar

Or automatically numbered:

 #. Item 1
 #. Item 2

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    def foo():
        print "Love Python, Love FreeDome"
        print "E文标点,.0123456789,中文标点,. "

.. code-block:: c++
    :linenos:

    //注释
    class A{
        int i; /*注释*/
        char j;
        void f(){
            if( i == 0){
                print("\n");
            }
        }
    }

.. literalinclude:: code/my.sh
    :language: shell
    :linenos:

.. literalinclude:: code/main.cpp
    :language: cpp
    :linenos:

Inline Markup
-------------
Words can have *emphasis in italics* or be **bold** and you can define
code samples with back quotes, like when you talk about a command: ``sudo`` 
gives you super user powers!
